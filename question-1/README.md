# Question 1: Binary Heaps

## Description
This program builds a max-heap from the given array `{21, 18, 85, 15, 36, 75, 63, 65, 90, 70, 89}`.
It then inserts a new node (96) and ensures the max-heap property is maintained.
Finally, it deletes the node (96) and ensures the max-heap property is retained.

## Compilation and Execution
1. Save the code in a file named `binary_heap.c`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `binary_heap.c`.
3. Compile the code using the following command:
   ```sh
   gcc -o binary_heap binary_heap.c
